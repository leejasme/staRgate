Description: An R-based automated gating pipeline for flow cytometry data designed 
    to mimic the manual gating strategy of defining flow biomarker positive populations 
    relative to a unimodal background population to include cells with varying 
    intensities of marker expression. The pipeline’s main feature is a flexible 
    density-based gating strategy capable of capturing varying scenarios based on 
    marker expression patterns to analyze a 29-marker flow panel that characterizes 
    T-cell lineage, differentiation, and functional states.
