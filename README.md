# staRgate
A density-based automated gating pipeline for flow cytometry data to characterize the lineage, differentiation, and functional states of T-cells

This GitHub stores the {staRgate} R package.

# Installation

The {staRgate} package relies on a few Biocondcutor R packages.
Before installing {staRgate}, first setup Bioconductor and install all packages. 

+ {flowCore} and {flowWorkspace} are dependencies for the {staRgate} package
+ {openCyto}, {flowAI}, {ggcyto} are not required to run the functions of {staRgate} but are used in the full gating pipeline as shown in the [Tutorial](https://leejasme.github.io/staRgate/articles/vignette_run_pipeline.html)

[Please refer to Bioconductor for full details on installation guidelines](https://www.bioconductor.org/install/)

```
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

```

To install staRgate (currently install from GitHub): 

```
devtools::install_github("leejasme/staRgate")
```
