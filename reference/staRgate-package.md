# staRgate: Automated gating pipeline for flow cytometry analysis to characterize the lineage, differentiation, and functional states of T-cells

An R-based automated gating pipeline for flow cytometry data designed to
mimic the manual gating strategy of defining flow biomarker positive
populations relative to a unimodal background population to include
cells with varying intensities of marker expression. The pipeline’s main
feature is a flexible density-based gating strategy capable of capturing
varying scenarios based on marker expression patterns to analyze a
29-marker flow panel that characterizes T-cell lineage, differentiation,
and functional states.
